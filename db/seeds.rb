# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# first = Game.create(name: 'Call of Duty', summary: 'testing', release_date: Date.today, category: 4, rating: 5.6)
# Game.create(name: 'Call of Duty 2', summary: 'testing', release_date: Date.today, category: 4, rating: 5.6, parent_id: 1)
